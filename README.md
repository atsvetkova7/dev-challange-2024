Basic functional requirements


1. Interface:
Create a simple, intuitive user interface.
The visual style should be based on the MFA website: https://mfa.gov.ua/
Provide a clear structure where users can quickly find the options they need (uploading files, choosing a graph type, settings).
A detailed description of the interface elements is given below

2. Data upload:
The tool should support uploading data in CSV, Excel, JSON formats, manual data entry into the input field.
Support for drag and drop of files.
Ability to preview the uploaded data in a tabular format before building a visualization.
Resistance to errors and unforeseen situations (incorrect data, empty files, etc.).
Test data can be found at the link.

3. Selecting the type of visualization:
The tool should provide the ability to create at least 3 types of visualizations: line graph, bar chart, pie chart.
Add a simple mechanism for selecting the type of visualization (e.g. drop-down menu or buttons).
HTML, SVG, and CANVAS can be used to display graphs.

4. Customize charts:
Provide users with the ability to customize basic graph settings: colors, axis names, titles, line styles.
The interface for changing the color palette of the graph should be interactive and user-friendly (e.g. color selection through a palette).
The graph should be able to be animated.
Graph scales should be calculated using extreme values.
The legend should be placed inside the graph, but not interfere with the main data.

5. Adaptability:
The application should work correctly on all devices: desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Ensure smooth adaptation of the interface to different screens.

6. Export of visualizations:
Implement the ability to export ready-made visualizations to PNG, PDF, and SVG formats.
Add functionality to save charts as separate images (download button).
Print to printer (print only the graph, without the interface and unnecessary elements).

7. Documentation/Interactive tips:
Add short interactive instructions or tips to help users understand how to use the tool.

8. Application performance.
The speed of loading and processing large amounts of data.
The application works without delays. 
Smooth animations.
